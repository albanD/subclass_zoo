    "possible that there *accidentally* were four nonzero elements, but\n",
    "I wouldn't bet on it!)\n",
    "\n",
    "Case (2) has some useful applications; however.  If you are given an\n",
    "arbitrary model with no annotations, you can replace all of the input\n",
    "sizes with flexible sizes, run the model, and get symbolic formulas\n",
